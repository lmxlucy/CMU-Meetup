    We focus on how you can choose your career to have the greatest impactâ€”whether by focusing on alleviating global poverty, trying to prevent future pandemics, trying to prevent nuclear war, and lots more.
     
    Every semester we run a fellowship that outlines all of the areas in which you can have the most impact with your career. The fellowship *is* a bit of a time commitment, taking 3-4 hours per week for eight weeks. There will be weekly meetings and reading assignments. Food will be provided at no cost to you.
    
    We are part of a global movement with groups at every top university. We frequently collaborate with Stanford, MIT, and Cambridge. We welcome both undergrads and graduate students."}
